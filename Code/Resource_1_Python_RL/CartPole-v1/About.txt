Num	Observation	Min	Max
0	Cart Position	-2.4	2.4
1	Cart Velocity	-Inf	Inf
2	Pole Angle	~ -0.418 rad (-24°)	~ 0.418 rad (24°)
3	Pole Velocity At Tip	-Inf	Inf


In this specific case, Discrete(2) means the agent has two distinct, separate actions it can choose from.
For the CartPole environment, these two actions typically correspond to:

0: Pushing the cart to the left.
1: Pushing the cart to the right.


What do we need to search for.
We need to create an algorith, to choose the action To get the most reward.

We know here that we have no agent till now. The decision regarding the action is randomly chosen
with the function sample()
