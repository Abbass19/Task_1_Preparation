A Great Problem Here is the Understanding of his Requirement
    he has written some code based on some assumptions (actions , selling policy ...)
    Knowing what assumptions/boundaries for the problem sort of Explains the code itself.
    After that is becomes essential to accurately write MY_PROBLEM_STATEMENT and LIST_OF_ASSUMPTIONS

All this Work was an Implementation to the DQN philosophy of Building a Model



Assumptions Taken:
    1.The code operates under a simplified trading assumption where the agent’s actions are limited to a binary
       buy/sell policy combined with a hold option. In this setup, the agent either buys one unit of stock, sells
       one unit, or holds without any position change. The quantities are discrete and fixed, meaning the agent
       does not decide how many units to buy or sell, nor does it consider available capital or risk management.
       This assumption greatly simplifies the problem, allowing focus on learning the timing of buy and sell
       decisions without dealing with complexities like portfolio sizing or fractional trades.

    2. In this implementation, the entire trading decision process is based on a single parameter—namely, the stock
        price at each time step. This simplification is intentional to reduce complexity and focus the learning problem
        on timing buy and sell decisions without considering multiple market factors or additional features. By limiting
        the input to just one parameter, the model and environment become more manageable for initial development and
        experimentation. However, this design assumption also means the agent operates under a highly simplified
        representation of the trading environment, which may limit its applicability to real-world scenarios where
        many variables influence decision-making.
















Notes:
    1. In this mode, the accumulation of older older data are present if the data is not in the state.
        And this is weird. But we can't know through bisection of the NN of what each part of the NN does.
        I mean the way the human brain has different spot for different activities. We would remain clueless
        of what's inside. We can numerically say they some Optuna hyperparameter tuning, can make it some how better.
        But we can't diagnose that this NN needs more memory for this input size. We can't make an diagnoses based
        on some observations

    2. There are two main ways to assess whether a neural network has learned something meaningful: logical
        experimental design and software-based explainability tools. The first involves scientific techniques
        such as ablation (removing parts of the input or model), training on randomized data, and behavioral
        evaluation — all of which help systematically test hypotheses about the model’s learning. The second
        relies on explainable AI tools like SHAP or LIME, which provide visual or numerical insights into what
        parts of the input influenced the model’s decisions. For developers, the scientific way of thinking is
        more important, as it forms the foundation for structured reasoning, meaningful testing, and informed
        improvement. Explainability tools are helpful, but they serve best as supportive instruments guided by
        a solid experimental mindset.


    3. There is a very tricky concept in the Timeseries data decision making. That is the certainty of taking choices.
        And the relevant point (perspective/ reference / Science grade 7) you calculate the losses and wins. Lets say you
        have sold a number of stocks today. You compare the value of money with the time you buyed them. But who knows what
        happened tomorrow. If the price tomorrow increased by 10 fold, you will consider yourself out of luck because of such
        a bad decision although is it mathematically profitable in every metric.

    4. The Q-value is updated only for the action actually taken because the agent learns from its real experiences, not
        hypothetical alternatives. At each step, the agent observes the reward from the chosen action and the estimated future
        rewards, then updates the Q-value for that action to better predict its true value. Updating only the taken action
        prevents the model from learning incorrect or unsupported information about actions it didn’t perform, ensuring
        stable and focused learning based on what actually happened.


Wrong Things in the Code
    1. Some coding errors in syntax and some bad practices (Human Genuine code not Gpt 2020 code)

    2. In the current implementation, the agent's training function is called after every single interaction with the environment,
        once enough samples are collected in memory. This frequent training approach is inefficient and can lead to unstable learning
        because the model updates are based on very limited and highly correlated recent data. Training after each step prevents the
        model from benefiting fully from experience replay, which relies on sampling diverse and uncorrelated batches of past
        experiences to improve stability and convergence. A more effective approach is to accumulate a batch of experiences over
        multiple steps or episodes and then perform training by sampling random mini-batches from the replay memory. This method
        reduces correlation among training samples, improves computational efficiency, and leads to more stable and reliable learning
        outcomes. By moving the training phase outside the inner interaction loop, the agent can better leverage its collected experience
        and optimize its learning process.

    3. One of the key issues in the current code is that it does not follow the standard structure commonly used in reinforcement learning
        frameworks such as OpenAI Gym. The Gym API defines a clear and consistent interface where the environment encapsulates the state, action space,
        and reward logic, providing a step(action) method that returns the next state, reward, and episode termination flag. By not adhering to this standard,
        the code mixes environment dynamics and reward calculations within the training loop, which reduces clarity, modularity, and maintainability.
        Following the Gym API or a similar design pattern is considered best practice, especially for newcomers, because it enforces a clean separation
        of concerns between the agent and environment, improves code readability, and enhances compatibility with existing RL libraries and tools. Adopting
        such a structure early in development facilitates scalability and eases the integration of more advanced algorithms in the future.

    4. Within this simplified policy, the selling logic is incorrectly implemented. The current code sells only one stock unit at a time by popping a single
        price from the inventory list:This approach fails to account for scenarios where it might be optimal to sell the entire inventory at once rather than
        incrementally. For instance, in real trading, an agent may choose to liquidate all holdings simultaneously based on market conditions or strategy. The
        current code’s design can lead to suboptimal selling behavior and unrealistic trading simulations, as it restricts the agent to one-unit sells without
        flexibility.To address this, the selling action should be redefined to allow selling all held units at once or to implement a policy that manages partial
        sells with clear rules, reflecting a more realistic trading environment.
